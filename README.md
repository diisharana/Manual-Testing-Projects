# Manual-Testing-Projects

This project contains a list of details regarding manual testing that I have learnt throughout my career and my post graudation in Software Quality Assurance and Test Engineering.

#Basics of Testing

1. Software Development Lifecycle

   Participated for QA activity in all the steps of the SDLC
   
   1Ô∏è‚É£ Requirement Analysis <br>
   Discussion with BA/ PO regarding the requirement, discussing scenarios that would come up if a change is implemented, jotting down impacted areas, technical architecture of the new     changes involved. Describe what the software application/system needs to be to able to do. Mainly writeen in a way that is understood by everyone in the team. During this discussion we should also describe what the software application needs to be able to do but in more granularity. Technical discussions should take place at this stage.  <br>
   ‚òëÔ∏è Participated in Requirement analysis for portguese news web page created using word press, mobile web applications, Shopify applications in Shine Dezign Infonet Pvt. Ltd. <br>
   ‚òëÔ∏è Participated in the Requirement analysis for new features that were introduced for the HRIS system, which included multiple modules. Requirement analysis for the  introduction of triggers and change requests, handled the  requiremet analysis interdependent modules in CatalystOne Info. Solutions Pvt. Ltd. <br>
   ‚òëÔ∏è Participated in the requirement analysis for major releases which included Financial selector screen, Fraud Monitoring, implementation of Data model and partner integrations. Verified 
     the analysis and prepared edge cases accordingly in Spring Financial. <br>

   2Ô∏è‚É£ Planning
   Discussing development plan, test plan. Responsible for planning the testing that will be done during the sprint for the specific feature planned for deployment. This also include time taken for the test activirty, number of test cases required to be developed, executed, created, peer-reviewed, turn-around time for fixing defects. <br>
   üîº Establishing the scope- Number of use cases, requirement specifications, modules, classes, functions, methods to be tested, number of platforms to test the requirement on, anticipated number of defects that could be found and keeping extra bandwidth while providing estimations. Lastly mentioning the environments to test and devices.

   ‚úî Created test plans for Kanaban team in Shine Design focusing on the new features, the Test plan was created using MS Excel, consisting of scenarios to be tested (higher level), hours spent on the activity and tracking the overall advancement of the testing process, environment in which the change is to be tested. <br>
   ‚úî In CatalystOne a defined Test Plan was created based on Estimation techniques- Work Break Down Structure, it was important to focus on the Risk-Based Priority Driven Testing and Business critical flows as part of the SIT Team, therefore the Test Plan for any feature focused on business critical flows and the Risky areas, once those were handled, a top-down approach was planned for other areas. The hours spent are inclusive of testing on staging environment (integrated environment) and sandbox environment. The Test plan and test cases were created in TestLink. <br>
   ‚úî In Spring Financial, due to the urgency of requirements the Test Plans are created as Phase Test Plan. i.e. Focusing on all test items included in the Sprint. The test planning also included creation of test cases and execution in the feature branch, release branch and the master branch. Test cases are created using Qase. <br>

   In short, during the test planning I have focused on Analysing the code/ requirement/ user Stories ‚è≠Ô∏è Develop the Test Strategy ‚è≠Ô∏è Develop Test Plan and Test Case(s) ‚è≠Ô∏è Execute the Test Case ‚è≠Ô∏è Create and Publish Reports
